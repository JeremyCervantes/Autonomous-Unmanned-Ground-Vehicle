# Autonomous-Unmanned-Ground-Vehicle
A year long design project for senior engineering students at Manhattan College. Created an autonomous vehicle that can provide needed supplies to areas that would be inaccessible otherwise.
# What I Learned
• Utilize both GPS and Magnetometer to find destination and calculate a desired heading angle. 

• An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect moving objects in the vehicles path in which it will stop driving at a calculated distance from the moving object.

• Apply the Thermistor to detect temperatures in the vehicle to prevent from overheating.

• This project required the use of an Arduino board.
